# AzureBot
The AzureBot is a sample that showcases how the Microsoft Bot Framework and Cognitive services can be used to create intelligent bots. The sample was created to show how a bot can be used to improve the productivity of any developer, admin, or team working with Azure. If you would like to set it up yourself and contribute, follow our [Developer Set Up](https://github.com/Microsoft/AzureBot/blob/gh-pages/docs/DeveloperSetup.md).

We maintain the latest version of the sample running in the [Bot Framework Bot Directory](https://bots.botframework.com/bot?id=azurebot), where you can try it via Skype, Slack or GroupMe. 

The current implementation focuses on authenticating to the user's Azure subscription, selecting and switching subscriptions, starting and stopping RM-based virtual machines, and listing and starting Azure Automation runbooks.
